This response demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the task and grammatical competence.  It's essentially meaningless and shows no attempt to answer a question or fulfill a prompt.  The repetition of "this is to test" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of sentence structure and English usage.  The candidate needs significant improvement in their English language skills before they can achieve a passing score.  This response would receive a very low score (likely a band score of 1) across all four assessment criteria (Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy, and Pronunciation if spoken).
