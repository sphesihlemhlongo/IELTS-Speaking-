The candidate's utterance, "again we're testing if the microphone is recording," is inappropriate for the IELTS speaking test.  It reveals a lack of understanding of the test format and demonstrates an inability to engage naturally in a conversation.  I would likely respond with a neutral and slightly guiding prompt, such as:

"Let's move on to the next question, please.  Could you tell me about a time you had to solve a difficult problem?"  (Or a similarly appropriate question relevant to the section of the test).


This response avoids directly addressing the candidate's inappropriate comment while smoothly redirecting them back to the task at hand.  The comment itself would be noted in my assessment, negatively impacting their fluency and coherence score.
