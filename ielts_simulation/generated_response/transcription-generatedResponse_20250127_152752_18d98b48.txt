The candidate's opening is hesitant and contains several repetitions ("I'll I'll," "say say," "a bit about myself my name is").  This significantly impacts fluency and coherence.  While the content is understandable – intending to introduce themselves and the topic – the delivery needs considerable improvement.  I would provide feedback focusing on these points:

"That's a good start in terms of introducing yourself and your topic, Py. However,  your delivery was quite hesitant, with several repetitions.  Try to practice speaking more smoothly and confidently.  Avoid repeating words and phrases.  For example, instead of 'I'll I'll just say say a bit about myself,' you could simply say 'I'd like to briefly introduce myself and the topic of my presentation'.  Practicing your opening several times beforehand will help to eliminate the hesitations and improve your overall fluency score."
