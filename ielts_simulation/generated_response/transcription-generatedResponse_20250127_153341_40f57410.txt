The response "I am the deal" is insufficient and doesn't address any prompt or question.  To provide feedback that helps the candidate improve, I need to know the context.  What question was asked?  Was this a speaking test, a writing test, or part of a task?

Assuming this was part of a speaking test, for example, in response to a question like "Tell me about a time you negotiated something," the response is completely inadequate.  My feedback would be as follows:

"While I appreciate your attempt to be concise, your answer, 'I am the deal,' doesn't provide any relevant information.  To effectively answer this question, you need to describe a specific situation where you negotiated something.  This should include details such as:

* **The context:** What was the negotiation about?
* **The parties involved:** Who were you negotiating with?
* **The process:** What strategies did you use?  What were the challenges?
* **The outcome:** What was the result of the negotiation?

Remember to use examples to illustrate your points and to speak fluently and coherently.  Your response needs to show your ability to describe a situation in detail and demonstrate your English language skills."


If this were in a writing task, the feedback would similarly focus on the lack of development and the need to provide specific examples and detailed explanations to support any claims.  The response lacks coherence and doesn't meet the minimum requirements for a satisfactory answer.  The feedback would emphasize the importance of addressing the essay prompt directly and providing sufficient evidence.
